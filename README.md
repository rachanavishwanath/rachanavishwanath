### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Rachana Vishwanath, software engineer with experience in building full stack web applications implementing technologies like React, Redux, PostgreSQL, mongoDB, Ruby on Rails, Express.

I have recently finished a 1000+ hours intense bootcamp at App Academy which is highly selective and immersive where I spent more than 80 hours a week honing my technical skills.

When I am not coding, I like to spend time with my family, especially my daughter, she is the joy of my life. I am a yoga addict, love spending time in nature and cooking/baking.

My additional skills include JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, webpack, github, Node.js, debugging.

I have 5 years of Quality Assurance, with strong analytical skills, experience in automation, functional, regression, UAT Testing, web services. I am ISTQB certified, decisive, efficient and contributive team member, have outstanding communication skills.
