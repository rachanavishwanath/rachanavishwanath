### Hi there 👋

I am Rachana Vishwanath, software engineer with experience in building full stack web applications implementing technologies like React, Redux, PostgreSQL, mongoDB, Ruby on Rails, Express.

I have recently finished a 1000+ hours intense bootcamp at App Academy which is highly selective and immersive where I spent more than 80 hours a week honing my technical skills.
